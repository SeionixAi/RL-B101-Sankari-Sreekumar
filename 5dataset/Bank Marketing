🎯 Problem Statement

The objective of this project is to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on demographic, financial, and campaign-related attributes.

This is a binary classification problem, where:

deposit = yes → Customer subscribed

deposit = no → Customer did not subscribe

💼 Business Context & Relevance

Direct marketing campaigns are costly and time-intensive. Accurately predicting which customers are more likely to subscribe allows the bank to:

Reduce operational costs

Improve campaign efficiency

Increase conversion rates

Optimize customer targeting

A reliable predictive model can significantly improve marketing ROI.

Numerical	age, balance, duration, campaign, pdays
Categorical	job, marital, month, poutcome
Binary	default, housing, loan
Ordinal	education
Datetime-related	day
🧹 Data Preprocessing
1️⃣ Missing Values

No explicit missing values detected.


2️⃣ Duplicate Handling

Checked for duplicates.
No duplicate values


3️⃣ Outlier Treatment

Outliers detected using boxplots and skewness.

balance and duration showed strong right skew.



4️⃣ Categorical Encoding

Binary features encoded as 0/1.

Ordinal encoding applied to education.

One-hot encoding applied to nominal categorical features.

drop_first=True used to reduce multicollinearity.

5️⃣ Feature Scaling

Standardization applied 
Required for scale-sensitive models (e.g., Logistic Regression).

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
✔ Distribution Analysis

Age moderately skewed.

Balance highly right-skewed.

Duration extremely skewed.

✔ Class Imbalance

Majority class: “no”

Minority class: “yes”

Potential need for resampling or class weighting.

✔ Feature vs Target Insights

duration strongly associated with subscription.

poutcome_success highly predictive.

age shows weak separation.

balance moderately influential.

✔ Correlation Analysis

Limited multicollinearity observed.

Duration highly correlated with target.

⚠ Key Observations & Modeling Considerations
🚨 Data Leakage Risk

The feature duration represents call duration and is known only after the call is completed.

Including it in modeling may cause unrealistic performance.

Recommendation:

Build models both with and without duration.

⚖ Class Imbalance

Potential bias toward majority class.
Solutions:

SMOTE

Class weighting

Stratified sampling

📉 Skewed Features

Log transformation recommended for:

balance

duration

🔍 Modeling Readiness

Dataset is suitable for:

Logistic Regression

Decision Trees

Random Forest

Gradient Boosting

XGBoost

Tree-based models may perform better due to:

Non-linear relationships

Skewed feature distributions

Outliers

💡 Feature Engineering Suggestions

Log-transform skewed features

Create age bins (young, middle-aged, senior)

Interaction features (e.g., balance × campaign)

Drop or separately analyze duration to avoid leakage

📈 Potential Next Steps

Model comparison (Logistic vs Random Forest)

Hyperparameter tuning

Cross-validation

Feature importance analysis

ROC-AUC evaluation

Precision-Recall analysis (due to imbalance)
